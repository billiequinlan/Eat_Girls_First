		<p> The three of us met on a web development course (sexy, ey) and instantly connected over a handful of Celebrations. We got talking about food; how it can be really hard to be healthy in the City and how great it would be if there was a one stop shop for advice. And so, Eat Girls First was born. We wanted to make it easier for others (and us) to maintain a healthy, hassle free lifestyle without sacrificing any joy. Our website was created to show that being healthy in London isn't a chore, in fact, for all you foodies out there, eating nutritious and delicious food in our marvellous capital is easy when you know where to look!</p>

		<p> The plan was to share our favourite healthy food spots in London; it was also an excuse for us to hunt more down and scoot on over to try them out so we could write a little review next to each recommendation. So thank you for giving us a reason to fill our bellies with food and our hearts with love! </p>

		<p> We soon realised that whilst eating out is wonderful and having someone else cook for you is just delightful it can quite quickly burn a rather large hole in your wallet. That's when we added our recipe section, now you can cook up a nutritious feast from the comfort of your kitchen. Entertian loved ones, host a dinner party for friends or simply make a mess in your kitchen for no other reason than your own happiness. Some of the recipes are our own, others we have adapted from our favourite foodies and the rest are meals we love the look of and can't wait to try out - if you beat us to it, please leave a comment so we know wether to try it or bin it! </p>

<div class="col-sm-6">
		<p> Whilst it's all well and good us showing you where to eat and what to eat, we realised there was a missing component - why! Why should you eat this way? Why are these foods nutritious? Why will they bring you health and happiness? We believe it's so important for everyone to reconnect with their bodies and understand the foods that really fuel them and that's why we've included a free 30 minute health consultation with our very own certified Health Coach, Billie. Sign up for a session with Billie and she will help you determine your health goals, make a couple of healthy swaps in your diet and answer any of those burning diet related questions you have. </p>
